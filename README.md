## Useful to always have
Keep [this](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) saved somewhere, as this is the docs to discord.py@rewrite.
All you need to know about the library is defined inside here, even code that I don't use in this example is here.

# Optional tools
### Flake8
Flake8 is a tool that helps you keep your code clean. Most coding softwares will have a plugin that supports this Python module so it can be integrated with your IDE. To install it, simply do `pip install flake8`. If you're using python 3.7, install by doing `pip install -e git+https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8#egg=flake8`

### PM2
PM2 is an alternative script provided by NodeJS, which will reboot your bot whenever it crashes and keep it up with a nice status. You can install it by doing `npm install -g pm2` and you should be done. Keep in mind that this PM2 file is made to work on my own Linux instance, you might need to change the `interpreter` value.
```
# Start the bot
pm2 start pm2.json
